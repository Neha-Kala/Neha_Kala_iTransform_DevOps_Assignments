Develop a script that creates, sets and displays two variables to the terminal when run.
Within this script, add comments to explain what the script is doing, 
what each variable is and, using inline comments, what each command is doing.

---->
Solution

#creating variables
var1='A'
var2='B'

#variables created

echo "first variable is '$var1'"	#Display content of variable 1
echo "second variable is '$var2'"	#Display content of variable 2
