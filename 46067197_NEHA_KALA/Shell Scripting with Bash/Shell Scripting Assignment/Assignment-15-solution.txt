Create a script that prompts the user for a number.
That number is to be used to display a simple message to the terminal X number of times (where X is the number captured from the user input).
The message should include an indication of the number for each count the message is displayed.

#!/bin/bash

echo "How many times would you like to print Hello:"
read num
n=$num
i=1
for (( c=1; c<=n; c++));
do
echo $i "Hello" ;
i=$((i+1)) ;
done
