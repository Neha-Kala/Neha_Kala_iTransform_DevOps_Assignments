Write a script that will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 3. 
Capture that number in a variable and then test that variable. 
Be sure to display the variable and it's value as appropriate within an if/then/else statement 
where the final statement will display if they did not enter a number between 1 and 3 
telling them they failed to follow instructions. 
Redirect errors from each of the tests to /dev/null 
(to prevent script errors from showing if text is entered for example).


-->

#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number between 1 to 3 : "
read num

if [[($num -gt 0) && ($num -lt 4)]] 2>/dev/null
then
	echo "Number entered is appropriate"
else
	echo "Number entered is not in between 1 to 3"
fi



Result:
neha@neha-VirtualBox:~/assignment$ ./12.txt
Enter a number between 1 to 3 : 
2
Number entered is appropriate
neha@neha-VirtualBox:~/assignment$ ./12.txt
Enter a number between 1 to 3 : 
4
Number entered is not in between 1 to 3
